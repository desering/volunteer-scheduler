# Purpose

We considered the following products and services before deciding to build our
own volunteer coordination application.

## Google Sheets

We initially worked with a public Google Spreadsheet where anyone could enter
their name to indicate attendance for a certain volunteering shift. As the
community and the amount of volunteers grew, this spreadsheet became too
time-intensive to maintain and develop further, so we started to look for more
scalable alternatives.

## Giveety (previously Eternitee)

The [Giveety](http://giveety.org/) platform by the Swiss-based company
[tech-id](https://tech-id.org/fr/projets/giveety) focuses on international
volunteering opportunities. Their USP is a shared "time-currency" that makes
contributions comparable across countries and certifiable for example as proof
for studies that require a certain amount of community service as part of their
curriculum.

With Giveety, a volunteer must apply for an opportunity and be reviewed and
accepted. After the volunteer has given their time (usually a months-long stay
abroad), a certificate is requested, and again reviewed, and confirmed.

This does not fit our needs because we are looking for a system that allows
people to quickly and easily indicate their intent to contribute on a much
smaller, but ideally repeating level.

See a working example of Giveety [here](https://sosmediterranee.giveety.org/en).

## Teamup

[Teamup](https://www.teamup.com/) presents themselves as a customizable business
calendar. Features like self-booking, recurring events and user roles make it an
interesting option for De Sering.

Initially, Teamup would do a lot of basic features better than any self-built
application. However, in the mid- to long-term we would run into limitations
when it comes to insights and skill-building of potentially 1000s of volunteers.
