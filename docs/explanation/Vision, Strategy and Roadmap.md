# Vision, Strategy and Roadmap

## Context

De Sering is scaling from a small, highly relational volunteer group (~100
people) to a much larger organization (1,000+ volunteers). The Scheduler
redesign is driven by this shift: the need for a structured system that supports
volunteer growth, empowerment, and long-term engagement. Informal tools like
WhatsApp groups, shared calendars, and manual follow-ups no longer provide the
visibility or continuity required at this level of complexity.

Existing coordination systems (e.g. TeamUp) focus primarily on filling shifts,
with limited insight into volunteer participation over time. Volunteers often
lack clarity on how to grow or take on greater responsibility, while
coordinators lack data on skills, training and engagement. This makes it
difficult to intentionally develop new coordinators and leaders as the community
expands.

The Scheduler aims to centralize shifts, trainings, events, and communication in
a single platform that supports both participation and progression. This
document provides shared context and direction to align contributors and guide
sustainable development as De Sering continues to evolve.

## Vision — Why & Where

> Vision Statement:
> To build an open, community-owned coordination system that enables volunteer
> organizations to scale sustainably.

The Volunteer Scheduler is an open, community-owned coordination system designed
to support volunteer organizations at scale. Its purpose is not only to
coordinate shifts, but to provide clear, durable structures for participation,
training, and leadership over time.

The system is designed to make opportunities and capacity visible. Volunteers
should be able to see shifts, trainings, events, and gatherings in one place,
understand how roles connect, and identify ways to deepen their involvement.
Coordinators should have an overview of skills, training, and engagement,
enabling more intentional planning and development.

The Scheduler is purpose-built for volunteer-driven organizations and
prioritizes transparency, customizability, and maintainability over generic
convenience. In the long term, it is intended to function as open-source
infrastructure that can be reused by other community organizations, while
supporting De Sering’s sustainability and independence.

## Strategy — How & What to Focus On

To support De Sering’s growth and realize the Scheduler’s vision, we are making
a small set of deliberate strategic choices about what to build, how to build
it, and what to prioritize.

**Custom-Built**

De Sering is building the Scheduler instead of using tools like Google Calendar
or Teamup, which are limited to basic scheduling. A custom system allows us to
support volunteer growth, model roles and trainings, and avoid pricing and
platform constraints as we scale.

**Focus on Growth and Visibility**

The Scheduler prioritizes clarity for both volunteers and coordinators.
Volunteers can easily discover shifts, trainings and events, while coordinators
gain visibility into participation, skills and capacity to support intentional
planning.

**Built for Contribution**

The Scheduler prioritizes contributor accessibility through widely used
technologies, clear ownership, and roadmap-aligned contributions.

**Open Source by Intent**

The Scheduler is designed to be open-sourced and reusable, guiding architectural
and scope decisions toward long-term shared infrastructure.
